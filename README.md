# Reimagine the e-commerce experience
*A concept project to explore e-commerce of today and tomorow.*

The mission is simple start from the ground up and build a solid foundation with well tested development practices. Pair it with 
over 10 years of retail experience and continously improve the project over time. 

-------------------------------------------



### First round of development is done 2022-04-23

The Goal of this initial phase was to document and explore a complete development lifecycle
and to deploy a minimum viable product to test and improve over time. 


#### Planning Phase 
Analyzing purpose of project
Deciding on core functionality in regards for a minimum viable product.
Sketching out general architecture to best meet the core functionality requirements.
Deciding on frameworks and design patterns for good development practice.

#### Development 
Start to construct the basic building blocks of the application starting with creating a API project and adding SQLite as our 
development database and using EntityFramework to help us access our database data. Entity Framework works well with .NET and the
migration to a production database later on will be streamlined with the help of Entity Framework. After constructing the basic infrastructure 
for storing and retrieving products and users from our development database we move onto the client part where we display information to users. 

For our client we'll be displaying a basic e-commerce webshop UI in a browser. This will be built using the Angular Framework, Node.js.

#### Deployment
Build project and deploy it so the e-commerce site can be accessed by anyone over the web.
